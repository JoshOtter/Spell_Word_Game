# Spell_Word_Game
 Defend towers within the timelimit by typing words to cast spells.
 
This game takes inspiration from games like Epistory and Nanotale. You play as a mage who has to defend four towers in a forest from bomb minions that are rushing towards them, hoping to blow them into dust.

This was the first game I attempted to build when I learned C# and Unity. It is currently unfinished, but I plan to come back to it soon because I love games that utilize typing as part if its mechanics.
